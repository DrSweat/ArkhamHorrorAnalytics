 Wilson takes pride in always having the right tool for the job. Leaky plumbing? Pipe wrench. Fallen tree? Hand saw. Interior remodeling? Sledgehammer. But recently his jobs in and around Arkham have taken on a certain strangeness. Creaky floorboards give way to labyrinthine tunnels. A broken roof shows signs of bursting outward instead of collapsing inward. It's Wilson's job to fix problems, and when those problems involve bizarre and horrifying creatures and unexplained phenomena, well, then it's time to get creative with what he's got.<br />
